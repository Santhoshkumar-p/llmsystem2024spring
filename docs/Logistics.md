## Description and Objectives

Recent progress of Artificial Intelligence has been largely driven by advances in large language models (LLMs) and other generative methods. These models are often very large (e.g. 175 billion parameters for GPT3) and requires increasingly larger data to train (e.g. 300 billion tokens for ChatGPT). Training, serving, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs require sophisticated engineering with modern hardware and software stacks. Developing scalable systems for large language models is critical to advance AI. 


In this course, students will learn the essential skills to design and implement LLM systems. This includes algorithms and system techniques to efficiently train LLMs with huge data, efficient embedding storage and retrieval, data efficient fine-tuning, communication efficient algorithms, efficient implementation of reinforcement learning with human feedback, acceleration on GPU and other hardware, model compression for deployment, and online maintenance. We will cover the latest advances about LLM systems in machine learning, natural language processing, and system research. 


## Time and Location

Monday and Wednesday, 5-6:20pm, POS A35 (in-person expected)


## Prerequisites

You are highly recommended to take either Deep Learning (11785) or Advanced NLP (11-611 or 11-711) course previously.


## Class Format

Each class will contain 
- 40 minutes of lecture 
- 30 minutes of either code-walk through or 30 minutes of student presentation of an assigned latest paper. 
- The remaining 10 minutes will be discussion and review of the content. 

Occasionally, we will invite industrial speakers to present latest advancement and engineering practice in building real LLM systems.


## Homework, Exam and Grading

The course will have four graded components. Please submit your homework on canvas.

|                       | Percentage             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Homework              | 10% each, 50% in total |
| Reading and Review    | 10%                    |
| In-class Presentation | 10%                    |
| Project               | 30%                    |


## Discussion Forum

We will use the Ed platform for discussions, but coming to office hours is also encouraged. You may send private message on edstem platform as well.


## Textbook and Course Material 

No text book is required. A select set of recent papers on LLM systems and algorithms will be provided. Students are expected to read the assigned material and papers before each lecture.
